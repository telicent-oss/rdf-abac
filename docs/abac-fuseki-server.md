# RDF ABAC: Fuseki Server

The `rdf-abac-fuseki-server` module provides a ready-to-go implementation of an Apache Jena Fuseki server that can be run immediately from the generated jar.

This allows users to immediately test and experiment with the functionality on offer.


## Examples
### Running the server (Intellij)
I have included some Intellij runtime configuration - [LocalServer](../.idea/runConfigurations/LocalServer.xml). 

### Running the server (manually)
Assuming the version of the repo is 0.71.10-SNAPSHOT and the command is being run from the "docs" directory.
```bash
java -jar ../rdf-abac-fuseki-server/target/rdf-abac-fuseki-server-0.71.10-SNAPSHOT.jar --conf=../rdf-abac-fuseki/src/test/files/server/documentation-example-config.ttl
```
This will run a server accessible from port 3030 with two datasets called `/unsecuredDataset` and `/securedDataset`.
They can be interacted with via the following urls:
* http://localhost:3030/securedDataset
* http://localhost:3030/unsecuredDataset

As the names suggest, one is configured to make use of ABAC and the other is not.  

### Configuration
#### Service
If we review the configuration below, we can see that we have defined a Service ("secureService") and named it "securedDataset".
We then further define it to have 3 operations, more colloquially thought of as endpoints.

By also providing the endpoints with names, we can ensure that the path is as we would like it to be.
Note: query is called "query" by default.
* http://localhost:3030/securedDataset/query
* http://localhost:3030/securedDataset/read
* http://localhost:3030/securedDataset/update
```rdf
:secureService rdf:type fuseki:Service ;
    fuseki:name "securedDataset" ;
    fuseki:endpoint [ fuseki:operation fuseki:query ] ;
    fuseki:endpoint [ fuseki:operation fuseki:gsp-r ; fuseki:name "read"] ;
    fuseki:endpoint [ fuseki:operation fuseki:upload ; fuseki:name "upload" ] ;
    fuseki:dataset :dataset ;
    .
```

#### Dataset

```rdf
:dataset rdf:type authz:DatasetAuthz ;
    authz:dataset :inMemoryDatabase;
    authz:attributes <file:documentation-example-attribute-store.ttl> ;
    authz:tripleDefaultLabels "!";
    .
```


### Queries (Secured)
#### Upload
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3030/securedDataset/upload' \
--header 'Security-Label: !' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/trig' \
--data-binary '@../rdf-abac-fuseki/src/test/files/server/documentation-example-data.trig'
```
*Note:* We are indicating that the default label be "!" such that any data without an explicit label; defined is not accesible

#### GSP-R
##### User Paul
This will return all the data that user Paul is able to see.
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3030/securedDataset/read' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer dXNlcjpQYXVs'
```
*Note:* We are using the base64 encryption of `user:Paul` to query.
##### User Jane
This will return all the data that user Jane is able to see.
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3030/securedDataset/read' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer dXNlcjpKYW5l'
```
*Note:* We are using the base64 encryption of `user:Jane` to query.

##### Other users
You can swap out the bearer values above for the remaining users (as defined in the user attribute config) with the following:

| User  | Base64           | Accessible item count (of 13) | 
|-------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Laura | dXNlcjpMYXVyYQ== | 6                             |
| Frank | dXNlcjpGcmFuaw== | 3                             |
| Ryan  | dXNlcjpSeWFu     | 6                             |
| Jane  | dXNlcjpKYW5l     | 6                             |
| Paul  | dXNlcjpQYXVs     | 12                            |

##### Count
This query (for user Jane) will return 6 results as that is all that Jane has access to see.
```bash
curl -X POST --location 'http://localhost:3030/securedDataset/query' \
--header 'Accept: application/sparql-results+json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/sparql-query' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer dXNlcjpKYW5l' \
--data 'SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?count)  WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }' 
```

### Queries (Unsecured)
#### Upload
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3030/unsecuredDataset/upload' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/trig' \
--data-binary '@../rdf-abac-fuseki/src/test/files/server/documentation-example-data.trig'
```
*Note:* The lack of a securityLabel header. It will be ignored if included. 

#### GSP-R
A general query will return all the data in the dataset. 
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3030/unsecuredDataset/read'
```

*Note*: The lack of authentication - it is unsecured after all. 

##### Count
This query (again for user Jane) will return 13 results, unlike the 6 above, as no access control is being applied.
```bash
curl -X POST --location 'http://localhost:3030/unsecuredDataset/query' \
--header 'Accept: application/sparql-results+json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/sparql-query' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer dXNlcjpKYW5l' \
--data 'SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?count)  WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }' 
```
*Note:* Any user will return 13. It can also be run without any user authentication (or the previous Accept header - as it is the default)
```bash
curl -X POST --location 'http://localhost:3030/unsecuredDataset/query' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/sparql-query' \
--data 'SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?count)  WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }' 
```
